Algo DSA-Search-Engine
In this project I have Web Scrapped about 1000 problems from LEETCODE using Python Liabraries like Selenium and Beautiful Soup.
For the Search-Engine I have implemented a TI-IDF Algorithm in the Backend that is being precomputed in a txt file. The search results give the 5 most relevant
questions from LEETCODE.
