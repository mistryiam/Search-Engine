Given two strings s and t, each of which represents a non-negative rational number, return true if and only if they represent the same number. The strings may use parentheses to denote the repeating part of the rational number.
A rational number can be represented using up to three parts: <IntegerPart>, <NonRepeatingPart>, and a <RepeatingPart>. The number will be represented in one of the following three ways:
The repeating portion of a decimal expansion is conventionally denoted within a pair of round brackets. For example:
