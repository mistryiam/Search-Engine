You are given two strings stamp and target. Initially, there is a string s of length target.length with all s[i] == '?'.
In one turn, you can place stamp over s and replace every letter in the s with the corresponding letter from stamp.
We want to convert s to target using at most 10 * target.length turns.
Return an array of the index of the left-most letter being stamped at each turn. If we cannot obtain target from s within 10 * target.length turns, return an empty array.
