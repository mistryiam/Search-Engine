An integer x is a good if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is different from x. Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone.
A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. For example:
Given an integer n, return the number of good integers in the range [1, n].
