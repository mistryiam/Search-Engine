We can use run-length encoding (i.e., RLE) to encode a sequence of integers. In a run-length encoded array of even length encoding (0-indexed), for all even i, encoding[i] tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value encoding[i + 1] is repeated in the sequence.
Given a run-length encoded array, design an iterator that iterates through it.
Implement the RLEIterator class:
