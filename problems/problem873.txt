A sequence x1, x2, ..., xn is Fibonacci-like if:
Given a strictly increasing array arr of positive integers forming a sequence, return the length of the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence of arr. If one does not exist, return 0.
A subsequence is derived from another sequence arr by deleting any number of elements (including none) from arr, without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3, 5, 8] is a subsequence of [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
