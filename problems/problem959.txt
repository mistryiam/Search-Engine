An n x n grid is composed of 1 x 1 squares where each 1 x 1 square consists of a '/', '\\', or blank space ' '. These characters divide the square into contiguous regions.
Given the grid grid represented as a string array, return the number of regions.
Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a '\\' is represented as '\\\\'.
