In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.
If the town judge exists, then:
You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi.
Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.
