You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a double booking.
A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events.).
The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.
