You are given a binary array nums and an integer k.
A k-bit flip is choosing a subarray of length k from nums and simultaneously changing every 0 in the subarray to 1, and every 1 in the subarray to 0.
Return the minimum number of k-bit flips required so that there is no 0 in the array. If it is not possible, return -1.
A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
