There is an m x n binary grid matrix with all the values set 0 initially. Design an algorithm to randomly pick an index (i, j) where matrix[i][j] == 0 and flips it to 1. All the indices (i, j) where matrix[i][j] == 0 should be equally likely to be returned.
Optimize your algorithm to minimize the number of calls made to the built-in random function of your language and optimize the time and space complexity.
Implement the Solution class:
