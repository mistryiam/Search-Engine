Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper and citationsis sorted in an ascending order, return compute the researcher's h-index.
According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have at least h citations each, and the other n  h papers have no more than h citations each.
If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.
