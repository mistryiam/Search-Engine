Implement the BSTIterator class that represents an iterator over the in-order traversal of a binary search tree (BST):
Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number, the first call to next() will return the smallest element in the BST.
You may assume that next() calls will always be valid. That is, there will be at least a next number in the in-order traversal when next() is called.
