You are given an m x n binary grid, where each 1 represents a brick and 0 represents an empty space. A brick is stable if:
You are also given an array hits, which is a sequence of erasures we want to apply. Each time we want to erase the brick at the location hits[i] = (rowi, coli). The brick on that location(if it exists) will disappear. Some other bricks may no longer be stable because of that erasure and will fall. Once a brick falls, it is immediately erased from the grid (i.e., it does not land on other stable bricks).
Return an array result, where each result[i] is the number of bricks that will fall after the ith erasure is applied.
Note that an erasure may refer to a location with no brick, and if it does, no bricks drop.
