You are given a string s of lowercase English letters and an integer array shifts of the same length.
Call the shift() of a letter, the next letter in the alphabet, (wrapping around so that 'z' becomes 'a').
Now for each shifts[i] = x, we want to shift the first i + 1 letters of s, x times.
Return the final string after all such shifts to s are applied.
