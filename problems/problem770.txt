Given an expression such as expression = "e + 8 - a + 5" and an evaluation map such as {"e": 1} (given in terms of evalvars = ["e"] and evalints = [1]), return a list of tokens representing the simplified expression, such as ["-1*a","14"]
Expressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction.
The format of the output is as follows:
