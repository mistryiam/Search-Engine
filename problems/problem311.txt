A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected byexactlyone path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.
Given a tree of n nodeslabelled from 0 to n - 1, and an array ofn - 1edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodesai andbi in the tree,you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node x as the root, the result tree has height h. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. min(h)) are called minimum height trees (MHTs).
Return a list of all MHTs' root labels.You can return the answer in any order.
The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.
