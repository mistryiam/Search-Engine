You are given the root of a binary tree where each node has a value in the range [0, 25] representing the letters 'a' to 'z'.
Return the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this tree and ends at the root.
As a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is lexicographically smaller.
A leaf of a node is a node that has no children.
