A maximum tree is a tree where every node has a value greater than any other value in its subtree.
You are given the root of a maximum binary tree and an integer val.
Just as in the previous problem, the given tree was constructed from a list a (root = Construct(a)) recursively with the following Construct(a) routine:
Note that we were not given a directly, only a root node root = Construct(a).
Suppose b is a copy of a with the value val appended to it. It is guaranteed that b has unique values.
Return Construct(b).
