Given a n * n matrix grid of 0's and 1's only. We want to represent the grid with a Quad-Tree.
Return the root of the Quad-Tree representing the grid.
Notice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.
A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:
We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:
If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.
Quad-Tree format:
The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].
If the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.
