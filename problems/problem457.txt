You are playing a game involving a circular array of non-zero integers nums. Each nums[i] denotes the number of indices forward/backward you must move if you are located at index i:
Since the array is circular, you may assume that moving forward from the last element puts you on the first element, and moving backwards from the first element puts you on the last element.
A cycle in the array consists of a sequence of indices seq of length k where:
Return true if there is a cycle in nums, or false otherwise.
