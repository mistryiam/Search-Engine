Given two strings a and b, return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between a and b. If the longest uncommon subsequence does not exist, return -1.
An uncommon subsequence between two strings is a string that is a subsequence of one but not the other.
A subsequence of a string s is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from s.
