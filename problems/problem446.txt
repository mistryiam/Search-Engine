Given an integer array nums, return the number of all the arithmetic subsequences of nums.
A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.
A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.
The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in 32-bit integer.
