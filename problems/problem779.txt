We build a table of n rows (1-indexed). We start by writing 0 in the 1st row. Now in every subsequent row, we look at the previous row and replace each occurrence of 0 with 01, and each occurrence of 1 with 10.
Given two integer n and k, return the kth (1-indexed) symbol in the nth row of a table of n rows.
