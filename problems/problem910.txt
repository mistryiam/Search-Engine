You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.
For each index i where 0 <= i < nums.length, change nums[i] to be either nums[i] + k or nums[i] - k.
The score of nums is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in nums.
Return the minimum score of nums after changing the values at each index.
