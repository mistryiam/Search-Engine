You are given an integer array nums of length n.
Assume arrk to be an array obtained by rotating nums by k positions clock-wise. We define the rotation function F on nums as follow:
Return the maximum value of F(0), F(1), ..., F(n-1).
The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.
