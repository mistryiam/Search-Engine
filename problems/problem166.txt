Given two version numbers,version1 and version2, compare them.
Version numbers consist of one or more revisions joined by a dot'.'. Each revisionconsists of digitsand may contain leading zeros. Every revision contains at least one character. Revisions are 0-indexed from left to right, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example2.5.33and0.1are valid version numbers.
To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in left-to-right order. Revisions are compared using theirinteger value ignoring any leading zeros. This means that revisions1and001are consideredequal. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, thentreat the revision as0. For example, version1.0 is less than version1.1because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are0and1respectively, and0 < 1.
Return the following:
