You are given an integer array nums of length n which represents a permutation of all the integers in the range [0, n - 1].
The number of global inversions is the number of the different pairs (i, j) where:
The number of local inversions is the number of indices i where:
Return true if the number of global inversions is equal to the number of local inversions.
