Given an array of strings strs, return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between them. If the longest uncommon subsequence does not exist, return -1.
An uncommon subsequence between an array of strings is a string that is a subsequence of one string but not the others.
A subsequence of a string s is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from s.
