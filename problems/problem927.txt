You are given an array arr which consists of only zeros and ones, divide the array into three non-empty parts such that all of these parts represent the same binary value.
If it is possible, return any [i, j] with i + 1 < j, such that:
If it is not possible, return [-1, -1].
Note that the entire part is used when considering what binary value it represents. For example, [1,1,0] represents 6 in decimal, not 3. Also, leading zeros are allowed, so [0,1,1] and [1,1] represent the same value.
