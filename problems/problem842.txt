You are given a string of digits num, such as "123456579". We can split it into a Fibonacci-like sequence [123, 456, 579].
Formally, a Fibonacci-like sequence is a list f of non-negative integers such that:
Note that when splitting the string into pieces, each piece must not have extra leading zeroes, except if the piece is the number 0 itself.
Return any Fibonacci-like sequence split from num, or return [] if it cannot be done.
