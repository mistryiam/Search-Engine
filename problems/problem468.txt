Given a string queryIP, return "IPv4" if IP is a valid IPv4 address, "IPv6" if IP is a valid IPv6 address or "Neither" if IP is not a correct IP of any type.
A valid IPv4 address is an IP in the form "x1.x2.x3.x4" where 0 <= xi <= 255 and xi cannot contain leading zeros. For example, "192.168.1.1" and "192.168.1.0" are valid IPv4 addresses while "192.168.01.1", "192.168.1.00", and "192.168@1.1" are invalid IPv4 addresses.
A valid IPv6 address is an IP in the form "x1:x2:x3:x4:x5:x6:x7:x8" where:
For example, "2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334" and "2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334" are valid IPv6 addresses, while "2001:0db8:85a3::8A2E:037j:7334" and "02001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334" are invalid IPv6 addresses.
