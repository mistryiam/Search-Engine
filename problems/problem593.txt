Given the coordinates of four points in 2D space p1, p2, p3 and p4, return true if the four points construct a square.
The coordinate of a point pi is represented as [xi, yi]. The input is not given in any order.
A valid square has four equal sides with positive length and four equal angles (90-degree angles).
