Given an integer n, return the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to n.
An integer is prime if it has exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. Note that 1 is not a prime number.
An integer is a palindrome if it reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left.
The test cases are generated so that the answer always exists and is in the range [2, 2 * 108].
