A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. Ifthe array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -.
You must write an algorithm that runs inO(log n) time.
