There is a safe protected by a password. The password is a sequence of n digits where each digit can be in the range [0, k - 1].
The safe has a peculiar way of checking the password. When you enter in a sequence, it checks the most recent n digits that were entered each time you type a digit.
Return any string of minimum length that will unlock the safe at some point of entering it.
