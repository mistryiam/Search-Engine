You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a triple booking.
A triple booking happens when three events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to all the three events.).
The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.
